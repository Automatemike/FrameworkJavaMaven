# FrameworkJavaMaven
Website Test automation JAVA code examples from the application of a Udemy course (link below) that I'm still progressing through.  Is a work in progress but is up for review by TTC SMEs.
Contains 3 websites chosen to start practicing the basics with and has comments through the code indicating the code's evolution.
Am looking to create a new project in IntelliJ IDEA to just focus on one (website) and develop the framework further around that.  This includes config code and utilities which are covered by the same course but have been skipped so far in order to be able to get basic tests up and running as coding practice and demo purposes.
